Plugin for the KDE "Comics" plasmoid for the comic strip Pooch Caf√©.

Code licensed under GPLv3 (or later). Icon is grabbed from . . . hmm, I *thought* I grabbed it from http://poochcafe.com/icongallery/ but I don't see it there. Either way, used under the *presumption* of fair use, but obviously not under a free license per se.
